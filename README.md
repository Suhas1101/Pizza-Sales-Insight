# Pizza-Sales-Insight

Welcome aboard, we're glad you're here to help!

Things are going OK here at Plato's, but there's room for improvement. We've been collecting transactional data for the past year, but really haven't been able to put it to good use. Hoping you can analyze the data and put together a report to help us find opportunities to drive more sales and work more efficiently.

Here are some questions that we'd like to be able to answer:

- What days and times do we tend to be busiest? - How many pizzas are we making during peak periods? - What are our best and worst selling pizzas? - What's our average order value? - How well are we utilizing our seating capacity? (we have 15 tables and 60 seats)

That's all I can think of for now, but if you have any other ideas I'd love to hear them â€“ you're the expert!

Thanks in advance

Pizza Place Sales

A year's worth of sales from a fictitious pizza place, including the date and time of each order and the pizzas served, with additional details on the type, size, quantity, price, and ingredients.

Recommended Analysis

How many customers do we have each day? Are there any peak hours?

How many pizzas are typically in an order? Do we have any bestsellers?

How much money did we make this year? Can we indentify any seasonality in the sales?

Are there any pizzas we should take of the menu, or any promotions we could leverage?
